# Car Dealer Inventory Project

This project simulates a used car dealer's inventory management using JavaScript. The car dealer has 50 cars in their inventory, and we'll use JavaScript's array methods like map, filter, and reduce to solve various problems.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into separate files for each problem and their corresponding test files. Each function takes the car inventory as its first argument.

- `problem1.js` and `testProblem1.js`: Retrieve information for a car with an id of 33.
- `problem2.js` and `testProblem2.js`: Find the make and model of the last car in the inventory.
- `problem3.js` and `testProblem3.js`: Sort car model names alphabetically.
- `problem4.js` and `testProblem4.js`: Get an array of all car years in the inventory.
- `problem5.js` and `testProblem5.js`: Find older cars (made before 2000) and log their count.
- `problem6.js` and `testProblem6.js`: Filter and return an array of BMW and Audi cars.
